                <p>
                    Hello there!

                    A little bit about me, I have always been curious about how websites and apps on our phones
                    works; how are they designed, and how do they
                    communicate with a server. So many questions about how.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And being an art student made me hyper-aware of the aesthetics of the website or app that I was
                    using. Like does this look good and how easy is it for me to navigate around. And this curiosity
                    kept growing. Working for two different companies in retail, both having subpar user experience on
                    their ecommerce platform. I would have customers coming up to me and tell me "your site doesn't let
                    me buy anything" or "how do I navigate this site". I could only agree with and understand their
                    frustration, it really made me think, is this hard, can I do it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Graduating right before the world shut down due to Covid, it halted all the plans I had. To find a
                    job in Interior Design, because it's what I studied and that's what people usually do after they
                    graduate. But it didn't really pan out like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward 2 years, I was still working in retail. The interest of software engineering was still
                    growing strong. And I wanted a career, and with a push and a shove from those around me, I took the
                    plunge, because hey, it doesn't hurt to try. I applied for a full stack software engineer with
                    Revature. A company that is essentially like a bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward another 3 months, my training was done. And I am looking for my next step in this new
                    career path of mine.

                <p>
                    Inspired by my time in retail at an outdoor gear brand, and most products had a limited lifetime
                    warranty. Limited warranty sounds amazing, until customers had to file them. The system for
                    filing a warranty claim did not allow customers to check on the status of the claim, or if they
                    decided that they no longer wanted the claim they could delete it. This led calls to the shop of
                    customers asking us, how long will this take, is there any update, which all we could do was
                    apologize to the customer that we didn't have any update and told them they just had to wait.
                    Sad face <i class="fa-solid fa-face-sad-tear"></i>, it sucks to keep apologizing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this app, I tackled just that, created an app where customers can file a warranty, where they
                    will be given a warranty number, which they can use to look up the status or if they wish to no
                    longer go on with the claim, they can also delete the claim.
